# 🌦️ Weather App

Welcome to the **Weather App** project! This web application provides real-time weather updates for any location, built using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and APIs.

## 📖 Project Overview

In this project, we will build a simple yet functional weather app that displays the current weather for a specific location. The app fetches live weather data from the **OpenWeather API** and updates the user interface dynamically using JavaScript.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the content.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: To handle user interactions and API calls.
- **OpenWeather API**: The source of live weather data.

## 🚀 Features

- **Real-time Weather Data**: Displays current weather information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more.
- **Asynchronous API Calls**: Fetches data using JavaScript's `fetch()` method along with an API key.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout is organized using a CSS layout model, ensuring it looks good across devices.
- **Dynamic Page Updates**: Weather information updates dynamically based on the user's query.

## 📚 What You’ll Learn

By working on this project, you'll enhance your web development skills and master the following concepts:
- Fetching asynchronous data using an **API key**.
- Organizing content using **CSS layout models**.
- Dynamically changing and updating the content on the rendered page.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
